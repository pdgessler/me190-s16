title: "Lab 3: Dealing with Arrays in MATLAB"
categories: lab
---

There is no formal lab report for this week.

We will spend the lab period this week going through the MATLAB array syntax.

This knowledge is critical to success in the remainder of the course.

# Assignment

After we finish covering the array material, send me a brief (roughly 2--3 paragraph)
email describing at least 2 things you learned about arrays in MATLAB.

I'm looking for things you found unexpected or unusual about arrays in MATLAB.
If you know another programming language, unexpected differences between MATLAB and the other language are acceptable.
If you don't know another programming language, think about your expectation and how MATLAB was different or the same.

You will receive full credit for this lab if you take the assignment seriously and list at least 2 items.

Send your email to me before 5pm on 6 April 2016 for credit on this assignment. We'll discuss your ideas in class.

Have a great break!
