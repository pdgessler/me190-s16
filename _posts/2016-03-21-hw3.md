Complete the following problems from your course textbook (Musto 2009):

- Problem 3.11
- Problem 3.15

Be sure to use comments liberally in your code to explain its operation.
For the function (Problem 3.15), make sure your function has some documentation
that MATLAB will display when I use, for example `help myfunction` on the command line in MATLAB.

Submit your work via a single email message. Please use the subject line:

> &lt;LastName&gt; HW3

replacing `<LastName>` with your last name.

Your email should include your source code as attachments: one file for each problem.

This assignment is due at the beginning of the Week 4 lecture period (4 April 2016).
